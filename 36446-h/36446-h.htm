<h2>AN ANNOUNCEMENT!</h2>


<p>We have made arrangements with the <span class="smcap">New York Photogravure
Company</span> by which we are enabled to offer a series of magnificent
Photogravures at a very low price.</p>

<p>The first is that which has been already published and described by
us, being the "COURT OF HONOR," at the World's Fair. The companion
to this is in preparation, and will shortly be ready. It represents
a view of the "ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AND COURT OF
HONOR," looking up from the Peristyle. These two pictures form a
magnificent souvenir of the World's Fair, and imperishable ones, which
have not been approached in artistic or technical excellence. Each
measures about 18 x 22 inches, and they are printed in the best style, on
paper 24 x 32 inches.</p>

<p>The next two pictures are photogravures from negatives made by
Mr. <span class="smcap">John E. Dumont</span>, of Rochester, and form admirable companion
pictures. Their titles are, "NO DOUBT," and "IN DOUBT," and
represent, in one case, a monk with a winning hand of cards, and having
no doubt what his play is to be. In the other, a monk holding a
hand of cards which evidently is a losing one, and, as evidently, he is
in doubt as to what to play.</p>

<p>The story of these pictures is admirably told, and with all the well
known skill of Mr. <span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.</p>

<p>The next in the series is a "LANDSCAPE WITH SHEEP," by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert S. Redfield</span>, of Philadelphia, and can well pass for a reproduction
of a painting by <span class="smcap">Verbeck Hoven</span>, not that it is in any sense a
copy of any picture, being entirely original, but in sentiment and feeling
equaling the best and most artistic work of the painter. As a companion
to this, "A STORM AT BRIGHTON" is published. This
was one of the prize pictures at the recent exhibition of the joint Societies
of Amateur Photographers of Boston, Philadelphia and New York.
It is exceedingly effective as a study of cloud and motion of water, and
forms an admirably suggestive study for artists. It is from a negative
by Mr. <span class="smcap">Ernest Edwards</span>, President of the New York Photogravure
Company.</p>

<p>The well-known picture of "Flirtation" has also been engraved for
this series, and will be very popular. This picture (it will be remembered)
appeared in the American "Annual of Photography" for 1892.</p>

<p>With the exception of the two first, all these pictures measure about
16 x 12 inches for size of work, and are printed on etching paper, 22 x 28
inches.</p>

<p>The uniform price of all is $2.00 each. For sale by all dealers.</p>

<p>Other subjects will follow, from time to time.</p>

packed, on receipt of price.</b></p>

<p>The object of this book is to present to the constantly increasing
number of persons seeking after practical knowledge in the art of
process engraving, a comprehensive and totally reliable text-book. The
book has been written with a view to instruct the amateur as well as the
professional, and the writer has always had in mind the beginner,
counting no detail too trivial to be fully described.</p>

<p>It has been written for the most part in the leisure hours, after practical
service during the day in a photo-engraving establishment, so that
the instruction goes directly from the shop to the pupil. It has been
the author's hope, in writing this book, to so carefully describe every
branch of work connected with the subject, that the beginner, who knows
absolutely nothing about it, may become a practical photo-engraver
from a careful reading of the work.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>About the year 1820 Nic&eacute;phore Niepce made the discovery
that bitumen, under certain conditions, was sensitive to light.
He dissolved it in oil of lavender, and spread a thin layer of
the solution thus obtained upon stone. This he exposed under
a drawing (making the paper transparent by waxing), and
after sufficient exposure, oil of lavender was poured on.
Those portions of the bitumen which had been exposed to
the action of the light had become insoluble, and so remained
while the lines which had been protected by the drawing
were dissolved away. By treating the stone with an acid
these lines were bitten or eroded, and could be printed from.
Niepce afterward employed metal plates instead of the stone.</p>

<p>Here we have the foundation for a number of printing
processes of the present day, including photogravure.</p>

<p>For many years, however, progress in processes for intaglio
printing was very slow. In 1852 Talbot introduced a process
termed photoglyphy, and in 1854 Paul Pretsch, of Vienna,
patented a process which he termed photogalvanography.
In 1870 the late Walter B. Woodbury, inventor of the Woodburytype
process, suggested to M. Rousselon, of M. M. Goupil
&amp; Co.,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> a process which he had discovered, and which he
describes<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> as follows:</p>

<p>"The method, as perhaps many of your readers know,
is based on the fact that some pigments used in carbon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>printing have an unpleasant habit of granulating when
mixed with gelatine and bichromate, destructive to their
use in carbon printing and Woodburytype, but bearing
the essence of success in an engraving process where
grain is necessary. The origin of this method was simply
owing to my getting some bad reliefs, in which this effect
was first noticed. Out of this arose the photo-engraving
process which, as I said before, is now claimed as the invention
of a Frenchman. But I am digressing.</p>

<p>"This relief, possessing a suitable grain, could, by hydraulic
pressure, be made to transfer its minutest details to metal
without any loss to fineness, so giving a plate possessing all
the properties of a mezzotint. The methods hitherto
used of electrotyping would have proved useless, as all
detail would have been lost. The same thing applies to
the new method I am now about to bring before your
readers. The latter process of getting the grain transferred
to a hard metal remains the same; but the novelty is in the
method of producing the grained plate. To those who have
practiced the process of enameling, as used by Geymet and
Alker, and others, my description will be better understood.</p>

<p>"I first coat a thin, polished steel plate (zinc will answer)
with a very thin coating of gum, glucose, and bichromate as
used for enameling. This I dry rapidly, and, while still
warm and desiccated, expose under a glass positive. On removal
from the frame after exposure the plate is made to
take up a slight amount of moisture by breathing on it.</p>

<p>"During this stage I brush or dust over it any hard powder,
such as emery, powdered glass, etc, but these I keep of
different degrees of fineness or coarseness. No. 1, is of a
coarse quality, and is used first; No. 2 is finer; and No. 3 is
of the finest grain obtainable. These are obtained by passing
through muslin of different degrees of fineness. Having
in the first stage of moisture used the No. 1, or coarsest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
powder, after a time No. 2 is dusted over and adheres to the
middle tints, while the very finest tones, which have almost
lost their sticky qualities by the exposure to light, are
treated to No. 3.</p>

<p>"Now we possess a granular picture having all the true
qualities required in a photo-engraved plate, or, rather,
such as will give a reverse in metal having these qualities.
The steel or zinc plate is then to be exposed to light to
completely harden the mixture all over, and is then treated
exactly as in my other engraving process; that is, pressed
into soft metal by hydraulic pressure, electrotyped, and then
the surface is aciercised or coated with steel. The dark
parts are thus represented by a coarse grain, the middle tints
by a medium grain, and the finest shades by the most infinitesimal
particles, thus meeting all requirements necessary to
a successful photo engraving process."</p>

<p>This process was taken up by a Frenchman and claimed by
him as his own invention. The chief difficulty with it was
that the plates before being perfect require the work of a
skillful engraver, sometimes for weeks. They were therefore
very costly, six dollars per square inch being charged
for the making of the plate alone.</p>

<p>Klic's process, 1886, was the next important improvement
in photogravure or intaglio printing, and since then many
other processes and improvements have been introduced by
Obernetter, Waterhouse, Colls, Zuccato, Sawyer and others.</p>

<p>In the following chapters Mr. H. R. Blaney gives a working
description of the process as practiced to-day by many
of the leading firms in this and other countries. This originally
appeared in the columns of <span class="smcap">The Photographic Times</span>,
but I have made many additions that I have imagined may
be of value to the student. A dividing line will be found
between Mr. Blaney's writings and my own additions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Negative.</span></h2>


<p>Any negative may be used for photogravure, that is, taken
from nature, or from a painting or engraving, provided it is
reversed, and, in the case of paintings, should, in addition,
be on an orthochromatic plate. The negative should be soft
and brilliant, well exposed, and not hard or under-exposed.
A reversed negative is always necessary if the print from
the copper plate is required to be similar in regard to right
and left, or if no other means are to be taken, to reverse the
image upon the copper plate. Professionals use stripping
plates especially made for this purpose for small work, or the
reversed negative may be made in the copying camera. A
fairly good reversed negative can be made by contact in
the printing frame from an albumen print from the original
negative, the print made transparent with white wax by
being placed on a piece of warm, clean metal and the wax
rubbed over the face. To have the negative reversed, the
print should first be placed, face out, against the glass of the
printing frame, with its back against the sensitive surface of
the transparency plate, the back closed in and exposed to a
large lamp for about five seconds. Every care must be
taken that you use the best of negatives, carefully retouched
if necessary, as the professional photographic etchers have
informed me that (from their standpoint) the success of the
whole process depends on the quality of the original negative
and the care taken in artistic retouching.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>It will often happen in commercial photogravure work
that plates have to be made from all kinds of original nega<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>tives.
In cases where these are flat from over-exposure it is
well to make a carbon transparency; intensifying the image
with a strong solution of permanganate of potash, and from
this make a fresh negative upon a slow or Carbutt transparency
plate.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Wilmer says: "The class of negative most
suitable is such as gives a good result by any of the printing
processes. A bright sparkling negative will always give a
good plate, but I do not find that any satisfactory results
can be got from a soft flat negative. The negative should
be as perfect as possible. It is absolutely useless to work
from a faulty negative. Contrasts on it may be increased
by retouching. Such contrasts are desirable because the
tendency of the etching is to reduce them somewhat."</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest way of obtaining a reversed negative
is by placing the dry plate in the slide film inside and exposing
through the glass, of course after allowing in focusing
for the thickness of the glass plate. With the wet-collodion
process, usually the method employed by large photomechanical
printers, this method can be used because it is a
simple matter to carefully examine the glass plate to be
employed, but it will be obvious that with the ordinary dry
plate all the imperfections of the glass, such as dirt, scratches,
air-bubbles, etc., will be clearly reproduced in the image.</p>

<p>Another method largely employed to produce reversed
negatives direct, is by means of a mirror or prism placed
either before or behind the lens. The prism is the more
convenient, but if large sizes are used it becomes a costly
piece of apparatus. The mirror, which should be a plane of
glass silvered on its surface, is a less expensive affair. By
either of these means the reversed negatives can be made
direct without suffering the least in quality.</p>

<p>With celluloid or other flexible films, printing can, of
course, be done from either side. Practical men, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
say that, except with the very thinnest films, there is an
undoubted loss of sharpness in the grain when these films
are reversed and with some mechanical processes.</p>

<p>Against this, however, it may be said that better contact
can be obtained in printing than if the film were upon a
piece of uneven glass, as is often the case, for by backing it
with a piece of plate-glass perfect contact is ensured everywhere.</p>

<p>We come now to the method of stripping the film from the
glass. If the negative is made by the collodion process the
matter is a simple one. The glass is treated with French
chalk previous to collodionizing. After the negative is
made and dried it is laid on a leveling stand and a solution
of gelatine poured on it. When dry, it is readily stripped
by running a knife all round. With ordinary dry-plates the
method usually recommended is to immerse them in dilute
hydrofluoric acid. The difficulty often experienced here is
in the lateral expansion of the film. This will largely
depend upon the plate, or rather the quality of the gelatine
used. There are, however, two methods of securing the
films to some medium unaffected by moisture, and so prevent
expansion or distortion. The first is that recommended
by Mr. A. Pumphrey and the second by Mr. H. J. Burton,
modified descriptions of which are given in a recent number
of <i>The British Journal of Photography</i>. If the negative is
varnished this is removed. A thin film of gelatine is moistened
in a dilute solution of hydrofluoric acid, one part of
acid to sixty of water. This gelatine film is secured on
paper by a coating of india-rubber.</p>

<p>The action of the dilute acid is to soften the gelatine,
making it very adhesive. It can, in this state, be readily
attached to the negative by squeegeeing. The acid in the
film passes through the negative, and releases it from the
glass. It can then be lifted off and pinned to a flat surface<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to dry. The paper can afterward be stripped off, when dry,
by moistening the back with a little benzole to dissolve the
india-rubber. In this manner we get the stripped negative
in exactly the same size as when on the glass, to which it
can be restored at any time desired.</p>

<p>Burton, in his method, employs collodion in place of paper
as the support. The negative is first coated with a thick
collodion, and this is allowed ten minutes or so to set. It is
then immersed in plain water until the film loses all appearance
of greasiness. A few drops of hydrofluoric acid are
added to the water, and the dish gently rocked. The film
will soon detach itself, when the plate should be at once
rinsed. Another plate previously coated with gelatine, and
dried, is placed in the dish, and the released film, after
reversing, is floated upon it, the two removed together, and
allowed to dry.</p>

<p>So far we have only treated upon reverse negatives, either
obtained at once or reversed afterward. It often happens,
however, that we have an ordinary negative, which is
required to be reversed. This negative may be a valuable
one, and the risk involved in stripping it be too great.</p>

<p>Another simple method of obtaining a reversed negative
is by means of the powder process. Although this process
is an old one, it appears to be but little known, for what
reason we have never been able to define. It is by no means
difficult, and by its means a negative can be obtained direct
from a negative without the intermediate positive transparency.</p>

<p>The principle of the process is this: An organic tacky substance
is sensitized with potassium dichromate, and exposed
under a reversed positive to the action of light. All those
parts acted upon become hard, the stickiness disappearing
according to the strength of the light action, while those
parts protected by the darker parts of the positive retain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
their adhesiveness. If a colored powder be dusted over, it
will be understood that it will adhere to the sticky parts only,
forming a visible image, the same being a reproduction of
the positive printed from. The process is very useful for
the production of lantern slides and transparencies, or for
the reproduction of negatives. Any of the following formul&aelig;
may be employed for the manufacture of the organic substance:&mdash;</p>

<p>The gum is first dissolved and the remainder of the ingredients
added. It may be necessary to warm the solution in
a hot water bath to dissolve it. It is then filtered through
flannel or clean muslin, and preserved for use in well-stoppered
bottles. With this solution clear glass plates are coated
and dried by a gentle heat over a small spirit lamp. The
plate while still warm is exposed under a reversed positive<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>

for from two to five minutes in sunlight, and from 10 to 20
minutes in diffused light. The image is then but slightly
visible. On removing from the printing frame the plate is
laid in the air (protected from light) for a few minutes to
absorb a little moisture from it. The next process is the
"dusting on." If the image is required to be black, fine
Siberian graphite is spread over it with a soft flat brush.
This will adhere to the parts unaffected by light, giving an
image of the positive. Any colored fine powder maybe used,
giving images in various colors. When fully developed the
excess of powder is dusted off and the film coated with collodion.
After this it is well washed to remove the unaltered
gum and dichromate salt. The film may, if desired, be
detached from the plate and used for enamels, ivory, wood,
textile fabrics, opals, etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Transparency.</span></h2>


<p>Regular transparency gelatine dry plates are the handiest
for making positives, especially for amateurs, if one does not
care if the subject is in reverse, or if one has a reversed
negative to work from. There is a "special" carbon tissue,
price $4.00 per roll of 2 &times; 12 feet, made by the Autotype
Company, of London, England, with full instructions appended;
by a system of double transfer, reversed negatives
may be obtained with this tissue. The "special" tissue is
only to be used for the transparency. A safe edge of black
paper is required on the transparency, pasted up exactly to
the edge of the picture, on the glass side; it comes, sold in
strips, gummed, ready for use, about &frac14; inch wide; this is
required, as the tissue used for the negative resist on the
copper plate, which is printed from the transparency, must
have a safe edge, shielded from the light, or it will not attach
itself to the copper plate, the tissue coming inside half way.
The screw pressure printing frame should have a piece of
heavy felt for backing the transparency.</p>

<p>The following instructions for making carbon transparencies
will no doubt be found useful:</p>

<p>The carbon tissue prepared for this process consists of
paper coated with gelatine containing carbon, lamp-black, or
other pigments.</p>

<p>The Autotype Company, of London, manufacture a special
"transparency" tissue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cutting up the Tissue</span> is performed by unrolling it gently
upon a zinc cutting plate, cut square and true, with the inches
marked at the bottom and right-hand side. By using a T<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
square and observing the numbered inches marked on the
plate, it will not be difficult to cut the tissue to any dimension.
If the tissue is very curly and unmanageable it should
be kept down with convenient weights. After cutting it up
to the required sizes, which should be conveniently smaller
than the dish to be used for sensitizing, it should be kept
flat under a metal plate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sensitizing the Tissue</span> is the next operation. This is
performed in a solution of potassium dichromate rendered
alkaline with ammonia. Tie over the mouth of a two-gallon
jug a piece of muslin, to form a kind of bag, into which place
fifteen ounces of potassium dichromate, then fill up the jug
with water and allow it to stand until the dichromate is dissolved
and the solution becomes cold. It is sometimes advisable
to regulate the quantity of dichromate. In hot weather,
or for very thin negatives, the proportion of water should be
doubled, while for very hard negatives only half the quantity
should be used. In very hot weather it is often advantageous
to replace about 30 per cent. of the water with the
same quantity of alcohol.</p>

<p>The operation of sensitizing the tissue must be carried on
in a room lighted by a window covered with a yellow blind.
A flat dish of porcelain, glass, or <i>papier mach&eacute;</i>, a squeegee,
and a sheet of glass or zinc larger than the tissue, will be
required.</p>

<p>The solution is poured into the dish, and should be at least
two inches deep. The tissue is then immersed in it, and the
air-bells that form immediately brush away from both sides
with a broad camel's-hair brush. The temperature of the bath
should not be higher than 60 deg. Fahr.; and the time of
immersion should be from three to five minutes. After the
tissue has remained in the solution for the allotted time it is
gently removed and laid face downward upon the glass or
zinc plate, and the back squeegeed, removing all superfluous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
solution. The tissue is removed from the glass and laid over
a sheet of cardboard, bent into the form of an arch, to dry.</p>

<p>Another method (H. J. Burton's) of sensitizing carbon
tissue is to lay it flat on a sheet of clean blotting paper, and
sponge on the back a very strong sensitizing solution composed
as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="4" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Potassium dichromate</td><td align='left'>4 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Liquid ammonia fort</td><td align='left'>1 ounce</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Water</td><td align='left'>20 ounces</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>First mix the ammonia with the water, then grind up and
add the dichromate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drying the Tissue</span> should be accomplished in a room perfectly
free from the noxious fumes of other chemicals, and
lighted only by non-actinic light. Tissues sensitized during
the evening should be dry on the following morning. It
should then be cut to the sizes required and kept flat in a
pressure frame, or other similar contrivance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exposing the Tissue.</span>&mdash;The tissue can be exposed behind
the negative in an ordinary printing frame, or in special
frames having no joint in the back, as no image is visible.
The negative must be furnished with a safe edge, made by
painting an edge about one-eighth of an inch round the
negative with black varnish, or by pasting on strips of red or
black paper. Exposure must be judged by an actinometer.
A very suitable instrument for timing the exposure of carbon
tissue is Sawyer's actinometer. It consists of a rectangular
tin box with a glass lid, bearing twelve tints graduated from
slight discoloration to a degree of opacity, representing the
extreme amount of deposit upon the lights of the densest
negatives, each division of this screen of tints bearing a number
in opaque pigments; and a roll of sensitive paper is placed
in the box, and the end pulled forward so as to pass under
the tints. When this arrangement is placed in the light, the
silver paper commences to discolor underneath the graduated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
screen, beginning of course at the lightest, but the number
on the tint being in an opaque pigment is preserved white,
and serves to register the progress of printing; for if, when
the lid is opened, the number one, for instance, shows clearly
on a tinted ground, the instrument is said to have registered
one tint; by that time the number two will have begun to
make its appearance, and, if sufficient exposure be given, the
light will print through the whole scale by successive steps,
and show up the numbers, one to twelve. With an instrument
of this kind it is evident that, by exposing alongside
the carbon tissue and determining the number of
tints required for the proper exposure of that negative, the
same number of tints with the same negative will always
prove right. A little practice will enable one to judge the
number of tints required for every class of negative.</p>

<p>It will be well to remark here that freshly sensitized tissue
will produce inferior pictures to that used a day or two after;
the pictures are not so hard, and there is less danger of the
high-lights being washed away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Continuing Action of Light.</span>&mdash;If the carbon tissue
after exposure to the light, be kept in the dark for a little
time the effect on the print will be precisely the same as if
the exposure to light had been prolonged. This continuing
action of light may often be utilized to advantage. Pictures
known to be under-exposed will, if kept till morning, by that
time have acquired the same force as if they had received
the proper exposure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Development</span> consists simply in dissolving the gelatine unaffected
by light, with hot water as the solvent.</p>

<p>Immerse the exposed tissue in a bath containing cold
water. It will first of all curl up, but afterward lay flat
and limp. It is then placed in another bath containing cold
water together with a sheet of glass which has previously
been coated with a 5 per cent. solution of gelatine. Bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
them together face to face, draw them out, and force into
close contact with a large squeegee; then place between
blotting paper for five or ten minutes. In squeegeeing, the
tissue should be uppermost, and a sheet of American cloth
laid over it to prevent the squeegee from damaging it.</p>

<p>Development should not be attempted for at least twenty
minutes, during which time the glass, with the tissue on it,
should be placed between sheets of blotting paper, and kept
under pressure to insure its adherence to the glass support.
After that time it is placed in a dish, and water heated to a
temperature of 100 deg. F. added. The colored pigment
will at once commence to ooze out of the edges, and after a
little time the paper originally holding the carbon film may
be removed with the hand. Then, by gently leveling the
picture with the hand, the superfluous gelatine will be
washed away, and if the exposure has been correct a perfect
image should remain. A certain amount of control can be
kept over an autotype picture. An over-exposed print will
show itself by insolubility of the gelatine, and the high
light refusing to be washed clear. The temperature should
be raised considerably, and hot water poured over with a
jug. If this fails to reduce the intensity, add a little
ammonia to the water as a last resource, though the better
plan is to make another print, giving less exposure. Under-exposure
results in over-solubility of the gelatine. The
half-tones will be washed clean away. It is rarely an under-exposed
print can be saved. All that can be done is to
reduce the temperature of the water. Development should
never be hurried; the slower it is the better the gradation
of tone in the results.</p>

<p>After development is complete the bichromate salt is
discharged, and the image rendered perfectly insoluble by
well washing in cold water and placing in a dish containing
a 5 per cent. solution of potash alum, after which it is again
washed and dried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Another method of making a transparency and one that
involves less trouble is by means of the transparency plates
which are now in the market. Of these we have tried Carbutt's
with the greatest success. For these the following
instructions are given:</p>

<p>The requisites are, a deep printing-frame a size larger
than the negative to be used, with a flat glass bottom clear
and free from scratches (crystal plate is best), a dark-room
Lantern, or other artificial light, and Keystone
Gelatino-Albumen Plates. Transparencies can be made
same size of negative by contact and exposure to artificial
light, or enlarged or reduced in the camera by daylight,
with equal perfection in result. To make transparencies by
contact place one of the Keystone thin crystal glass transparency
plates over the negative in printing-frame, lay piece
of dark soft material over it, close down the back, and expose
to the light of the lantern or to a gas flame or other
artificial light, for 10 to 30 seconds, according to density of
negative, at a distance of 20 inches from the flame. Use
the following developer:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Carbon Tissue&mdash;(Sensitizing and Exposure).</span></h2>


<p>The carbon tissue used as a resist, which is mounted on
the copper plate, is made by the Autotype Company, London,
England. No. 100 Standard Brown is the right grade to use,
though I have reached good results with No. 103. The No. 100
is a heavier grade than No. 103, and requires two or three
minutes longer exposure than the latter. Use a deep printing
frame with a screw pressure to secure absolute contact, which
is known by iridescent markings appearing on the glass of
the printing frame. A Johnson's actinometer is very useful
to time the exposure. From 4 to 6 tints are necessary.
Experience here is the only guide, as the light varies as well
as the density of the negative and the sensitiveness of the
tissue. If one does not have an actinometer, a slip of albumen
paper may be used; as soon as the paper has reached the
darkest point, which is then called one tint, extend it so that
a fresh portion comes out to the light, and so on for the
different tints. In September, for instance, the darkest tint
is reached in about 3 to 4 minutes; two tints and a half or
8 minutes in the shade at midday on a clear day in September
is about right,&mdash;this is understood to be with medium negatives
and No. 103 tissue sensitized within three days.</p>

<p>You should over-expose rather than under-expose, allowance
being made when the acid is used. Print deeply, so
that, on development, the negative tissue on the copper plate
shows all the detail clearly in the shadows. The tissue
should not appear very dark on the plate. The copper
should show up through the gelatine clearly and brightly.
The thinner the negative tissue, the quicker the biting of the
acid.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sensitizing the Tissue.</span></h3>

<p>The carbon tissue comes only in rolls of 2&frac12; feet by 12 feet,
price $3.00, not cut. It is not sold in a sensitive condition.
Full instructions with each roll for sensitizing. Tap water
will do, but I would suggest distilled water for making the
sensitizing solution of bichromate of potassium.</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="4" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Bichromate of potassium</td><td align='left'>1 ounce</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Water</td><td align='left'>16 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Alcohol</td><td align='left'>&frac12; drachm</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Ammonia</td><td align='left'>12 drops</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The best way to sensitize the tissue, is to place the tissue
face up, keeping it flat so that the solution reaches all parts at
once, removing all air bubbles, and rubbing in the solution
with the fingers until pliant; the time of immersion is three
minutes in winter, two minutes in summer. The hands
should be washed directly after handling the solution, and
care must be taken that there are no cuts on the fingers, as
the solution is very harmful, but if due care is exercised and
the hands well washed immediately with soap, little, if any,
trouble will be experienced; use rubber finger tips as much
as possible. Keep the temperature of the solution at 70 deg.
both in summer and winter. Take a piece of glass free from
scratches (an inch larger all round than the tissue); have the
glass ready cleaned with ammonia and talcum powder of fine
whiting, squeegee the sensitized carbon tissue directly from
the solution on to the glass and place to dry at night in a
light-tight box; it will be dry in the morning.</p>

<p>The tissue is in the best condition for three days after
sensitizing; it can be used up to seven days; it gradually
increases in sensitiveness from day to day. After a week or
ten days has elapsed, it is hard to manage and becomes unreliable.
When the tissue is dry take a sharp knife and cut
inside the edge, and strip off one corner. Fairly good results
can be reached by simply drying over a curved piece of pulp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
board, which is tied with string on each end, but squeegeeing
on glass gives a sharper result. The addition of ammonia
and alcohol to the sensitizing solution makes it easier to strip
the paper from the copper plate, after the carbon tissue is
mounted on the plate, and enables one to develop the resist
in the water at a lower temperature than without it, thus
avoiding pits in the darker portions and white specks or
bubbles in the lights, should the water reach too high a

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Cleaning and Graining of the Copper Plate, and
Grade of Copper Necessary, and Where and How
to Buy It at Reasonable Prices.</span></h2>


<p>The best copper is recognized by its rosy lustre. Pure
copper only should be used. It can be purchased ready
polished and beveled from several firms in New York. The
best way, if large quantities of plates are required, is to buy
the copper in the rough of one firm and have it polished by
another, and bevel it yourself if necessary with a file and
burnish it by hand, or the firm who polish it will do the
beveling for you.</p>

<p>The Scovill &amp; Adams Co. supply copper-plates of the
finest quality, ready polished, for photogravure work.</p>

<p>Total cost by this method about one-third less than by
purchasing ready made. It makes a copper plate 1/16 grade,
9 &times; 11, cost about $1.10. Order your copper 1/16 in. grade up
to 10 &times; 12; larger sizes 1/8 in. grade. If you use 1/16 in. grade
above this size, the plate is liable to buckle. Be sure the
plate is free from pits and scratches and with a high polish.
Have what the polishers and engravers call a rouge polish.
If they do not supply it, rouge it yourself with powdered
rouge and turpentine, using a ball of absorbent cotton over
a large piece of smooth cork. A good way to buy rouge is
in the stick; it is more economical. Rub the wet cotton on
it and the right quantity is assured. Pits in the copper may
be taken out by tapping upon the back with a nail set, using
a small piece of polished steel to lay the face of the plate on,
and localizing the spot with a pair of calipers. The part
raised by the tapping, cut away with the scraper, then rub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the spot with Scotch stone and water, then a piece of
engraver's charcoal (cut to a pencil point), with machine oil;
then burnish with the regular engraver's burnisher and
sperm oil, finishing with rouge and refined turpentine.</p>

<p>When the plate is well polished, make a strong solution of
caustic potash (C.P.), which comes in sticks, as strong as
possible, as long as it does not stain the copper. It should
register about 40 deg. with an actinometer used to test silver
solutions.</p>

<p>Take a piece of absorbent cotton and clean the copper
with potash (by the way, use finger tips); rinse under tap
for five minutes, then a fresh piece of cotton with alcohol at
95 per cent., rinse again with water, and place in warm water
for final rinsing; stand up on corner, or place in drying
frame usually used for negatives; allow to drain. Should
any stains appear, it must be recleaned and all the operations
repeated until it drains off without streaks, for these
streaks and spots of stain are caused by the caustic potassa,
which is difficult to remove. It is as hard to get rid of from
the copper as hyposulphite is from a negative. These streaks
retard the acid on the copper wherever they appear, and
cause defects in the recording of the original tones of the
negative.</p>

<p>The plate is then ready for graining.</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Graining the Copper Plate.</span></h3>

<p>A grain is required on the copper plate so that the tones
will be reproduced, as copper has not a sufficient grain of its
own. The grain is given to the copper plate by dusting it
with powdered Syrian asphaltum or resin. Have a paste-board
box made 18 inches high, 12 inches wide and 8 inches
deep, perfectly air-tight, with a small door running the whole
length on the widest side, an inch or two from the bottom.
Have the inside of the box perfectly smooth; place within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the box 4 ounces finely powdered Syrian asphaltum (sold by
Messrs. Theodore Metcalf &amp; Co., Tremont Street, Boston,
Mass.); it is difficult to find in New York. Shake the box
vigorously, place on table, insert a piece of wood an inch
high made in shape of cross (or open square, or have netting
of wire raised an inch from the bottom of the box); the
copper plate, previously cleaned, is at once placed face up
upon it. Instead of shaking the box it can be arranged upon
supports (see fig. 1), and revolved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<span class="caption smcap">Fig. 1.</span>
<img src="images/i_038.png" width="480" height="505" alt="Fig. 1." title="" />
</div>

<p>Close the door instantly, and let the plate remain about
two minutes; carefully remove the plate and place it on a
Florence oil lamp, holding the plate with a hand vise, watch
carefully until the powder disappears from the surface and
the plate slightly smokes, then stand aside to cool. Do not
keep the plate too long on the heater, or the particles of dust
will run together, forming an impenetrable varnish over the
plate. This part of the process is not difficult, but requires
practice. Preserve each atom of dust as much as possible,
examine with magnifying glass and, when cool, test with
finger nail; if it rubs off easily, it has not been heated
enough; then the plate must be re-cleaned and again pow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>dered.
To get a good all-round working grain, suitable for
medium subjects, the plate should be placed at once in the
box after shaking; thus the coarser particles that fall first,
and the finer, which gradually settle, will combine after two
or three minutes.</p>

<p>Many combinations will be suggested to the student by
practice to suit the subject; for instance, waiting for two
minutes and then inserting the plate, gives a fine grain for
delicate subjects. Powdered dragon's blood (resin) in combination
with asphaltum makes a beautiful grain; a separate
box may be used for the dragon's blood; the asphaltum first
dusted on the plate, then inserted in the dragon's blood box
for twenty or thirty seconds, then melted together. The
dragon's blood melts first, then the asphaltum.</p>

<p>The air brush is also used by professionals; it throws a
resinous spirit varnish, coarse or fine, as required.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Development of Negative Resist on the Copper Plate,
and Preparation for Biting with Acid through
the Gelatine.</span></h2>


<p>Have a wooden box made 24 inches long, by 12 inches high,
12 inches wide, with door 6 inches high on side, fastened with
hinges, top and bottom of box open; cover top with sheet
zinc. Place inside Florence oil lamp; the door is valuable
to regulate the heat. On top of box place deep porcelain
tray, 11 &times; 14, fill with water half full; in the water place two
pieces of plate glass &frac12; inch high and 4 inches long, on which
to place copper to keep it from the bottom of the tray. Slide
the copper plate into the water, removing all air bubbles,
keeping the fingers off the surface of the plate. Take the
sensitized and exposed tissue and place face down in the cold
water (65 deg.) sliding it gradually in at further end of the
paper so as to avoid air bubbles; the instant the paper curls
backward, place it over the copper plate and remove it
quickly from the water. This has to be done with celerity
or it will be found difficult to mount the tissue with the
squeegee on the copper, and also it should be exactly placed
with reference to the top and sides of the copper; all this,
of course, to be done under water, never allow it to slip up
out of it. Place plate on table and squeegee into place,
stroking firmly from the centre, each way. Place face down
on clean blotting paper, under heavy weight for fifteen
minutes. While plate is under pressure (which is necessary
to enable the gelatine to expand and attach itself to the
plate), start the lamp gradually, and by the time the paper
is ready the water should register on the thermometer 75 deg.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Slide the plate under water removing air bubbles as they
appear, with a ball of absorbent cotton; when the heat of
the water reaches 90 deg. Fahr., the gelatine commences to
ooze from all around the edges of the paper, and after the
plate has remained in the water about ten minutes after the
showing up of the gelatine (at the temperature from 90 to 95
deg.), take a pin and carefully raise the paper at the corner,
gradually pulling away the paper toward the opposite corner,
keeping the hand close to the water; should the gelatine
which adheres to the plate appear to lift, wait a few minutes
longer and start another corner. After the paper is stripped
from the plate, gently develop the negative resist with a
piece of fresh absorbent cotton, delicately rubbing the surface,
edges first, and lave the plate up and down in the
water, keeping the temperature steadily at 90 to 95 deg., by
raising or lowering the lamp. (Should the paper be under-exposed
and appear very black on the copper, develop at
100 to 110 deg., not over. If over-exposed it will appear
very thin, and the heat of the water must not go over 90 deg.;
it will strip at 88 to 90 deg.) Then the negative image
gradually appears, the darks first, which are of course the
brightest portions; when all detail appears in the shadows
and the negative stands out clear and bright, take it out of
the dark-room (which is lighted with an ordinary lamp), and
gently wash under the tap with clean and cold water at 65 to
70 deg.</p>

<p>Dry the resist with alcohol, pouring it over the plate from
one end, starting with half alcohol and half water, gradually
adding more alcohol and eliminating the water, until a final
flooding with absolute alcohol is reached; use fresh solutions
of alcohol and water for each copper; don't use old alcohol
for anything except cleaning the copper at the end, and for
removing the spirit varnish. Stand up to dry against the
wall, face out, and standing square on the bottom of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
plate, in the same position as you flooded it with alcohol; it
will be dry in twenty minutes if rightly flooded. The bare
copper should now be protected by a strong varnish in
alcohol (it must flow freely off the brush); a good varnish
for this purpose, and the best I know of, is an etcher's
asphaltum stopping-out varnish, sold by Messrs. Devoe &amp; Co.,
New York; price 50 cents per bottle. Should it get thick as
you come to the bottom of the bottle, add a little spirits of
lavender until it flows again freely. Take an architect's
ruling pen and carefully rule a line with the varnish up to
the edge of the picture, making it exactly true with the sides
of the plate and the space on each side of the work the same
with the top, the bottom space slightly larger; make sure
that it slightly comes inside the picture. Keep the rule away
from the surface of the gelatine, as it is very delicate. Then
cover all the rest of the copper, protecting the bare parts
and bevel, and bringing the varnish up to the line. Allow to
dry hard; about twenty minutes will do. Form a wall about
the resist, with walling wax, about an inch high; make a lip
at one corner, the further left hand one, for instance; see
that there are no leaks. There are several grades of wax, but
Liedel &amp; Co.'s is the best; when ordering you should give
the name as modeling wax; gray is a good color. Pans can
be used made of tin and varnished, or porcelain trays, protecting
the back and edges of the plate with varnish, but
I find the wax very helpful, especially on large plates.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Acid Baths.&mdash;How to Make Them and Method of
Biting through the Gelatine.</span></h2>


<p>Perchloride of iron C.P. is the acid generally used for
this purpose; it is a still acid, and if the room is well ventilated
no harm to health results, but care must be taken to
air the baths after making to get rid of the surplus chlorine.</p>

<p>Four baths are used, each of different strengths, the
strongest is used first, the weakest last. I quote from the
catalogue of the Boston Art Museum, of the exhibition illustrating
the technical methods of the Reproductive Arts and
Photo-Mechanical Processes, held January 8, 1892: "Photo-aquatint
(photogravure) for the production of half-tone intaglio
plates from photographs from nature, paintings, etc.
A dry aquatint ground is laid on a metal plate, and over this
is mounted a gelatine negative film, made by the pigment
printing process. To obtain this negative film a <i>reversed</i>
positive on glass has first to be made. The reason why this
positive must be reversed will become clear when the nature
of the manipulations in the pigment printing process, which
involves the turning of the film, are considered. The film
mounted on the plate is a washout relief, thickest in those
parts which are to show white in the impressions from the
plate, and gradually growing thinner toward the darkest
parts, where it is thinnest. The film acts as a 'resist' to the
mordant, allowing it to pass freely in the thinnest parts, and
less freely as it increases in thickness. If, however, the film
were mounted on the bare plate, and the biting then proceeded
with, the result would be of no practical use, as the
plate would present merely shallow hollows, incapable of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
holding the ink, and which would therefore be wiped out in
the attempt to clean the surface of the plate. This is, however,
prevented by the aquatint ground, which allows the
mordant to circulate only in the channels around the resinous
particles of which it consists, and thus produces a grain
precisely as in ordinary aquatinting. The mordant used in
perchloride of iron, which is a 'still mordant,' <i>i.e.</i>, one which
does not evolve bubbles of gas. An effervescent mordant
cannot be used as the bubbles rising under the film would
tear it up. In biting, successive baths of varying strength
are made.</p>

<p>"A strong solution of perchloride of iron penetrates only
the thinner parts of the film, whereas a weaker acts also
through the thicker parts. The biting, therefore, begins
with a strong solution, which acts only in the darkest parts,
and followed up with weaker and weaker solutions, which
continue the biting in the darks and at the same time carry
it on gradually toward the lights. If necessary, the plate is
worked over with the burnisher to brighten the lights, and
with roulettes, etc., to strengthen the darks."</p>

<p>Purchase nine (9) pounds of perchloride of iron in crystals
(45 cents per pound), take a wide-mouthed gallon jar, place
within half a gallon of distilled water, add the iron until it
tests 30 deg. by a Beaum&eacute; hydrometer, pour off enough to
fill a one-litre glass stoppered bottle, after filtering through
absorbent cotton. Keep adding the iron to the jar until the
strength of each bath is reached. To the strongest solution
add half a drachm of C. P. muriatic acid, and to the weakest
half a drachm C. P. nitric acid; the nitric acid is added so
that in the last biting a good final nip is given to the copper.</p>

<p>I here give my own formula, with those recommended by
others.</p>

<p>The four (4) baths should be well aired for a day (in broad
pans) in the open air before filtering.</p>

<p>Total of different bitings, from 10 to 25 minutes, according
to depth of printing. It always varies. There is no hard
and fast rule; you must in time learn to judge by your eye
alone. The acid will first attack the thinnest part of the
film, wherever that may be, and when the darkening of the
copper ceases to spread to the next thickest parts, instantly
pour off the acid, and pour on the 37 deg. Do not allow the
atmosphere to act on the gelatine while biting any longer
than is necessary to pour off one bath and quickly pour on a
new one. The 37 and 33 deg. baths are for the middle tones,
the 30 deg. for the most delicate ones. The action of each
bath is cumulative, the 37 deg. biting a little where the
42 deg. had bitten, the 33 deg. doing the same for those
before it, besides taking care of itself, and the 30 deg. attacking
all more or less. During the biting with the 30 deg. solution,
it should be continued until the whites just turn color, and a
minute beyond; that is, the copper should begin to show a
very little under the thickest and darkest film.</p>

<p>(Note that in the carbon resist the shadows are transparent
and the high lights are opaque.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The length of the last biting very seldom is over two
minutes. It is better to overbite your darks, and underbite
your lights, if you vary any.</p>

<p>The amount of moisture in the air and the heat of the day
influences the length of biting. In hot weather in summer
it is very difficult to work the process, the walling wax being
discarded and the copper (back and edges protected by
varnish) placed in a porcelain tray, surrounded by ice-water
and kept at 65 to 70 deg., and the acid pured over the plate
to the depth of one inch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Cleaning and Polishing the Plate, with Tools Necessary
for Retouching.</span></h2>


<p>When the biting is finished rapidly place the plate under
the tap and rinse thoroughly, breaking away the film with
your fingers; it seems to have rotted under the action of the
acid and is easily removed.</p>

<p>Remove the walling wax, clean off the varnish with chloroform
or turpentine, or alcohol first, and chloroform last. This
leaves a dim picture on the plate, with a kind of scum over
it; wet the plate with turpentine and start heavily with rouge,
rubbing to and fro equally all over the plate with a ball of
absorbent cotton; continue this treatment, using less and
less rouge and more turpentine until you give the final polish
to the high lights with a clean dry piece of cotton. Be very
careful not to overdo in rouging; the scum (if the biting of
the plate is of medium strength) should clear from the plate
with hardly a touch, and with very little rouging. Some
plates require a great deal of rouging; it then generally
means that you must look to your sensitizer. I again draw
your attention to the rouging; here is where any artistic
feeling you may possess will come into play with taste and
patience.</p>

<p>After the plate is rouged sufficiently, an engraver's burnisher
is used to clean up the highest lights and to modify
others. Two or three roulettes of different fineness are
valuable to touch up any darks that need deepening; it
matches very well with the grain, but I am always trying to
dispense with the use of the roulettes; one ought to get it
with the acid alone. A No. 6 sewing needle in a holder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
(dentist's pin-holder, screw end) is necessary to touch out
occasional white specks. You will have plenty of them at
first unless you look out carefully for dust on the film; keep
all your solutions constantly attended to by occasional filtering,
and don't use your sensitizing solution more than half a
dozen times; keep it well corked; if it gets old it scums the
plate too much.</p>

<p>Before final finishing by hand a working proof should be
printed from the plate by an expert plate printer, by which,
what the plate needs can be determined before final proving.</p>

<p>Have the plate proved on different papers, and with different
colored inks, so as to judge the effect. Imperial Japan
is the best paper, besides etching paper, India, thin Chinese
and Japanese papers. The cost of proving per single proof
is 25 cents for a 4 &times; 6 plate on Imp. Japan, about $2.00 per
doz. same paper; etching paper, about $5.00 per 100&mdash;less
for large quantities.</p>

<p>A second-hand D press, suitable for printing large or small
editions or for proving, can be bought in Boston or New
York for from $75 to $100. For instructions in printing see
Hamerton's "Etchers and Etching."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steel Facing.</span></h3>

<p>The life of a photogravure plate without steel facing does
not last much beyond 75 impressions, so that if an edition
is needed, send the plate to any good printer who will have it
steel-faced for you; their charges are very moderate, about 50
cents for a 4 &times; 6 plate. The steel-facing is accomplished by
first making the plate chemically clean, as before preparation
for graining, only be very thorough in using an old tooth-brush
to get out the dirt and in addition use chloroform before using
potash. Then solder a copper wire on to the back. The negative
wire is attached to the copper plate. To the positive pole of the
quart Smee battery is fastened a bright steel plate same size
of copper, in a gallon jar. The plates are hung from glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
rods &frac12; inch apart, a sufficient quantity of the following
solution to be poured into the jar:</p>

<p class="noidt">Filter, and let stand for 24 hours. Five (5) minutes will
cover the plate with a thin film of steel.</p>



<h3>(<span class="smcap">Obernetter's.</span>)</h3>

<p>"Place the copper plate in a porcelain tray on the bottom
of which rests a brightly burnished copper wire, the negative
pole.</p>

<p>"The anode on the positive pole, a bright steel plate, is suspended
over the copper plate, and kept in motion while the
circuit is closed. A precipitate of steel, resembling silver in
appearance, must instantly occur upon the copper plate, any
air-bells to be removed. Five minutes is sufficient to deposit
a perfect steel coating." Grease the plate after steel facing,
to keep off the rust. Formula:</p>

<p>"Merck's pyro has undergone a severe test in my hands. I find it
to possess many qualities which give it superiority over all other makes.
Authorities place the solubility of pyro as one part in two of water.
I found one ounce of Merck's to dissolve readily in 1:7 of water at 60&deg;.
It is extremely light, pure, and of a fine white color, giving rich negatives
full of vigor and sparkling brilliancy."</p>

<h2>The S. &amp; A. Photo-Engravers' Adjustable Screen<br />
Plate Holder.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 706px;">
<img src="images/i_061.png" width="706" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="center">(Patent applied for.)</p>

<p>This Holder, as is shown in the cut above, is a great improvement over any heretofore
manufactured for photo-engraving purposes. Its principal points of superiority are,
briefly:</p>

<p>First.&mdash;The ease with which it is adjusted for different size plates and screens, by a
simple sliding movement of the two inside frames to or from the centre, and thus dispensing
with the expensive and troublesome use of kit frames.</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;The convenience by which the screen plate is accurately adjusted to the sensitized
plate by means of the metallic sliding adjusters. (Heretofore it has been necessary
to do the adjusting by means of inserting different thicknesses of cardboard, paper, etc.)</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;Different thicknesses in the screen plates are allowed for by means of a spring
which always holds the plate in accurate place, no matter what its thickness may be.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;A graduated scale on each screen adjuster makes it easy to always insure absolute
accuracy in determining the distance of the screen plate from the wet plate.</p>

<p>Fifth.&mdash;The simplicity of construction and excellent workmanship of the entire holder,
being made, as it is, in the factory of the famous American Optical Company.</p>

<p>And, altogether, it is an ingeniously designed and beautifully constructed holder,
which will be found of indispensable aid to the practical photographer.</p>

<p>These holders are thicker than the ordinary plate holders, and if it is desired to use
them on a camera the ground glass of which is focused for the ordinary plate holder, a
new ground glass frame is necessary in order to adjust the focus. When ordering a holder
to fit a camera in use, send the old holder or the old ground glass frame, so that the new
ones can be made to fit the camera. Also state the size of largest and smallest screen plate
to be used in holder.</p>

<p>It is made in various sizes. Prices as follows:</p>

<p>Chrome-Gelatine is a perfected modification of the three-color printing
process. It is so named from the Gelatine process of printing being
used to produce the resulting pictures, which are allowed to be really
wonderful, and which may be reproductions from original Oil Paintings,
Water-colors, Views from Nature, Objects of Still Life, Textile Fabrics&mdash;indeed,
all classes of work copied from originals in color. The results,
in all cases, are produced from three-color negatives. Artists,
whose works have been reproduced by this method, express their satisfaction
of the results in the highest terms, without qualification.</p>

<p>Photogravures are of all classes of subjects.</p>

<p>An important modification of this process has recently been perfected
(patent applied for), by which the delicacy of the gelatine print is
maintained, at the same time that great strength and color is produced
in the shadows. The plates thus made are very durable, and show but
little wear after many thousands of impressions have been produced.
Moreover, they require no finishing or handling after having been
etched, and are quite easily printed.</p>

<p>Aquarelles are printed from photogravure plates, inked up locally
in a variety of colors. When the whole of the plate has been so inked,
the impression is pulled. The results are beautiful, but the process of
printing is exceedingly slow&mdash;three or four impressions a day, only,
being obtainable from a moderate sized plate.</p>

</div>


<p class="center ft20">DIRECTIONS FOR USE.</p>

<h4>THE SOLUTION.</h4>

<p>Five grammes (75 grains) <b>Anthion</b> are dissolved in one litre (one
quart) of luke-warm distilled water. The solution keeps for at least
one month.</p>

<h4><i>A. For Gelatine Plates.</i></h4>

<p><i>a.</i> The plate (13 &times; 18 centimetres&mdash;5 &times; 7 inches) or film, after fixing, is
allowed to drain and then washed for about five minutes in a dish with
about 600 cubic centimetres (20 fluid ounces) water; it is then again
allowed to drain.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Afterward it is laid in a second dish with 200 c.c. (7 fluid ounces)
<b>Anthion solution</b>, and again allowed to remain for five minutes with occasional
stirring.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The plate is then once more laid in 600 c.c. (20 fluid ounces) fresh
water, exactly according to direction <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The operations <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are repeated.</p>

<p>The plate is then <b>free from fixing soda</b>. (In order to determine this,
proceed as follows:)</p>

<h4><i>Test.</i></h4>

<p>To be certain that all the fixing soda is completely destroyed, proceed
as follows: Several c.c. (half to one teaspoonful) of the last washing
water are poured into a test-tube, and three or four drops silver
nitrate solution (1 to 20) added. A white precipitate generally forms.
If this gradually acquires a <b>yellow</b> tint, fixing soda is still present.</p>

<p>In such a case operations <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are to be repeated.</p>

<h4><i>B. For Positive Paper Prints.</i></h4>

<p>The operations are carried out as under A, but instead of one plate
five fixed copies (13 &times; 18 c.c.&mdash;5 &times; 7 inches) are taken, allowed to drain one
by one, then laid singly in water (vide <i>a</i>), afterward in <b>Anthion solution</b>
(vide <i>b</i>), then again in water (vide <i>c</i>), again in <b>Anthion solution</b> (vide <i>d</i>),
and finally in water.</p>

<p><b>It is important that the paper prints are frequently separated in
the different baths.</b> If the prints stick together, the solution does not
penetrate and cannot act.</p>

<h3>= IMPORTANT =</h3>

<p>For large plates and prints it is not only necessary to use larger
dishes, but also more liquid, both <b>Anthion solution</b> and water. An
excess of <b>Anthion</b> or of water is decidedly useful, but less is disadvantageous.</p>

<p>The above directions for washing relate to those who have no continual
flow of water at hand.</p>

<p>If a continual flow of water is obtainable, it is advisable to wash the
plates or prints in flowing water for a quarter of an hour, and then dip
in the <b>Anthion solution</b> and test the result as above.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
